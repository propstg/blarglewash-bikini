# blarglewash-bikini
This is an NPC-ran bikini wash. Drive to one of the Car Wash blips on the map and honk the horn to order a car wash.

Default locations are at the Yellow Jack and behind the large car wash in Los Santos.

Note: Not used or tested in the last 2 years, so almost definitely broken in some way due to updates.
